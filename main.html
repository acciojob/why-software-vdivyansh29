	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>What draws me to this field is the power of creation, the ability to build something meaningful from just an idea and lines of code. The community aspect of development is inspiring. Open-source contributions, collaborative coding, and continuous learning are all core to the developer journey. Itâ€™s a field where growth never stops, and the opportunities are truly global.</p>
